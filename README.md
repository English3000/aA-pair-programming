__STEPS__

(0) Setup day's projects:
* a ~ Open Terminal & Chrome.
* b ~ Create W#D# Folder on Desktop.
* c ~ Navigate into Folder, open Atom, and position windows in viewport.
* d ~ Download project zips; move them into Folder.
* e ~ Setup folders & files for other projects.
* f ~ Open & pin Progress Tracker (https://progress.appacademy.io) &
    Unit Curriculum (https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum) tabs (&
    optionally, a timer tab).

(1) Communicate with partner re: procedure for collaborating.

ASK: How comfortable do you feel with today's material?

AFTER PARTNER, RESPOND: I feel-- 
  - [ ] a bit more comfortable 
  - [ ] as comfortable
  - [ ] less comfortable than you
  
 --with it.

Whomever feels more comfortable should start as the Navigator.
If partners feel equally comfortable, whomever made the ASK should start as Navigator.

__For workflow, here's what I suggest:__

(2) Workflow

  I: Getting Started
  * a ~ Read over Project Intro paragraph (not the bullet points);
          indicate to partner when done reading.
  * b ~ Confirm first coding step.
  
  II: For Each Phase
  * c ~ Skim current paragraph; indicate to partner when done skimming.
  * d ~ Confirm next coding step.
  * e ~ Driver navigates to appropriate file.
  * f ~ Navigator re-reads aloud first/current sentence of current paragraph,
          as Driver codes it.
        Repeat (f) until new paragraph.
        Repeat from (c).
  * g ~ Switch roles every 15 minutes.

__Other guidelines:__

If you are the Driver, make sure the setup (Step 0) is complete.
Communicate on (0-c) viewport positioning.
Then, open the first/current project in a new tab from the Unit Curriculum tab.

From there, scroll to the Project Intro paragraph.
Align the header with the top of the viewport.

Begin the workflow (Step 2). Don't change the current tab or window without
instruction or confirmation of the Navigator.

__If you are unsure of the next coding step,__

(3) Getting Unstuck
  * a ~ Tell your partner.
  * b ~ If the Driver is stuck, the Navigator should narrate what to code.
        If the Navigator is stuck, the Driver should explain what to do, then
          code it.
        If both partners are stuck, the Navigator should re-read aloud the
          current sentence. If that doesn't help, re-read aloud the current
          paragraph. Then discuss what the next step will be.
  * c ~ If the instructions still don't make sense, the Driver should ask a
          question on Progress Tracker. Then the Navigator should instruct the
          Driver to navigate to resources to review while waiting or both skim
          the next paragraph.
  * d ~ Whenever the Driver googles something, do so in a new tab and close it
          after you're done using it to code.
